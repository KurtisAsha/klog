   I'm a data scientist. 
   Coding prerequisites include a big screen to not burden my failing eyes too much. A challenge to break the monotony. One cup of black coffee, hold the sugar and milk. A environment receptive to new ideas and critique. Often background music without lyrics otherwise I'll just sing along e.g. Chillhop or DnB. 1-3 chinwags to decompress. A healthy portion of food with all the trimmings. 
   Beyond coding: I lay my hat in London, UK, and share the utilities with my son and fiancé. I'm a fan of both basketball 🏀 and ⚽ football. Love a good read, mainly fantasy. Favourite books are The Gentlemen Bastard & Mistborn Series. I too like to game. I fell hard for Final Fantasy 8 back in the 90's and if limited to one dish for the rest of my life 🍕 pizza.
