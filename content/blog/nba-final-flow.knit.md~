## Project Introduction 👋🏽

Inspired by @PmInspiration, this analysis will use R to explore process mining on a subject I am fond of - basketball. I have played basketball all my life, although my failing left knee means I play infrequently in my older age.

I will be analysing game 5 of the 2024 NBA final between Dončić, Dallas Mavericks and Tatum, Boston Celtics. Well done Celtics 🍀, who last won a championship 16 years ago. I will avoid findings which could just as easily be found in a games summary statistics and focus on what unique insights process mining provides. Let us start with the data.
