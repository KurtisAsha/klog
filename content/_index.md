description: Welcome 🤗. Thanks for popping by. This is Kurtis' blog, klog for short. It serves to document my personal R related projects and to detail general data science issues I've journeyed the internet for and don't want to forget. In short, I'm using this site to unKlog my headspace 🙆🏽‍♂️. Inspired by new technology / analysis and the exploration of its value 👾.
